Evolve game/sim
===

The aim of this game is to create a simple evolution simulation which can be manipulated by various users.

Traits
---

Each living thing ought to have traits. These traits can be passed on to offspring.

  * should be incremental
  * should cost energy
  * can increase or decrease stochastically

### Propagation to offspring

If mating, the offspring will get the average of its parents' traits plus or minus a random deviation. If asexually reproducing the offspring will get the parent's traits plus or minus random deviations. Mating and reproducing cost energy.

### List of traits

  1. movement
    * Ability to move faster uses more energy (muscles)
    * Energy cost/movement
    * land/water trait influences speed/energy
  2. sight
    * Farther sight costs more energy
  3. temperature regulation
    * Difference in temperature between ambient and preferred costs energy
  4. water retention
    * Can venture farther from water but must eat more
  5. size
    * bigger = more energy, more damage
  6. healing rate
    * faster rate = more energy
  7. Aquatic
    * more aquatic = movement penalty on land

Eating
---

Creatures can eat proportionate to their size. Creatures can only eat dead animals.

Aging
---

Creatures have a maximum age they can live to.

World
---

The world can be changed in various ways:

  * Moving land mass
  * Drying up lakes/creating lakes
  * Changing temperature in regions


Future ideas
---

  * Interaction with obstacles such as walls
  * Make asexuality a trait
  * Photosynthesis
  * Creature groups (move in packs)
  * Sexual maturity age/longevity
  * intelligence
